Use your game file from last time.  Download and use python_functions10.py for this as there are updates (hideBackground function, gibdos, sand tiles).  You may wish to merge your enhancements with this python_functions file before you begin the video.  If you get stuck, game1.10.py is the completed file at the end of the video.

Enhancements - 
1. Add your scenes to this file such that link can move around your scenes and the maps that are already created.  You may have to modify maps 1-4 so that there are ways for link to leave those scenes.
2. Add a label to the HUD that will tell the player which scene they are in.
